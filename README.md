# prettybtab



To use:

prettybtab \[fretboard positions\]


Note, prettybtab is basic and does not have a lot of features. The idea is that you call it frequently, feeding it enough notes for a line or so, then copy+paste into your tab file. It gives you a basic outline which you can then further tweak by adding notations for hammer-ons, slides and such.
